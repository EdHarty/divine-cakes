DIVINE CAKES

Divine cakes is a python command line programme that provides an automated data solution for a fictional bakery.
Divine cakes is a local Bakery that provides the community with freshly baked goods. The bakery wants to collect data on seven of it's most popular cakes to improve profits. This has to be done in an efficient manner. 

The most popular cakes include:

-Strawberry Gateau

-Red Velvet

-Mocha

-Rocky Road

-Mint Chocolate

-Lemon Drizzle

-Carrot Cake

Staff arrive early in the morning to bake the stock in advance. If there is a particular cake that has sold out, more of that cake has to be made to meet demand. 
If stock is left over, they are discarded at the end of the day.
The aim of the command line programme is to (a) gather the bakery's sales figures, (b) calculate what is left over to give the bakery insight into how many of each cake should be made on a given business day. The primary outcomes are to reduce waste, improve efficiency and improve profitability of the bakery through the use of the python programme. This will also helo to predict sales in the future. In order to achieve this goal the python programme was linked with Google sheets so that the data could be pushed and pulled from the spreadsheet.

Objectives:

I wanted to create a command line python programme that was easy to understand and navigate. I wanted the user to be able to input data into the terminal and for this data to also be represented on a google sheet. I set up an Aplication User Interface (API) to make it possible for the applications to share data.
